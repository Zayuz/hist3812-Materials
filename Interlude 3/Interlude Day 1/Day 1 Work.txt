Day 1 Tasks:
After a week or two of working mostly on my Honours Project, most of my memory is a bit scrambled about other courses.
Re-read many of the course readings for this module of our course.
Note especially relevant ones to my own learning (AIDungeon, Archaeogaming, Oregon Trail)
Review Feedback from Interstitial 2
Examined worldbuilding project linked within! Reflected on this.
Consider what needs to be done for this project - NetLogo simulation of some sort (I connected better with this than audio focused material)
Googled examples of agent based models
Decided on the spread of a hoax as the basis (not copied from google)
Write reflection on this module
