Day 3 Work

It occurs to me today after decreasing the weight that I don't know how to create non-turtles akin to the woodchips used in the demo for the class.
However, after doing some googling it seems like the model is included. I opened the 'models library' and found an impressive roster of things programmed
in NetLogo! Trying a few, I think 'rumor mill' is the closest to what I currently employ, which can be seen in Ephemera.
Integrating some of the code from Rumor Mill into my own, I now have patches of land that change color based on the character that walks their and their color.
Unfortunately, I'm very sick today, which has made progress slower than it would normally be.
Trying out a few more models contained within NetLogo innately, I find that some very impressive things are possible. Clearly much more than I anticipated.


Imperative coding languages like netlogo are the opposite of what I usually work with, making this a unique kind of puzzle. In the past, the only language
of the sort I've used is R5RS, which was mainly to solve logic puzzles and sort databases. 
Trying to integrate termites with the rumor-mill style simulation, I've certainly broken everything. The turtles no longer move, and random squares turn slowly
from black to green... I cannot stop the simulation or redo the setup. Oh dear. (See Screenshot_1)
I managed to roll back to an earlier version, but lost the progress in which the turtles made paths that matched their colors. That's a shame!

...And the error comes back again just from trying to set the pcolor of the local tile to red or blue. Something is wrong! (See Broken Code image)
After some time, I've fixed it again. See the video 'Working streaks' to view the results.

That's a few hours into things, but not much has changed. Because I'm beginning to flounder I'll call the project here and begin to focus on my unessay!
