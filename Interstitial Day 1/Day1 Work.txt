Day 1 tasks:
Helped Mohammad determine how to turn his historical period into a game compatible with twine
and authentic with class material (playing a governor mediating between rebels and state using 
the algerian revolution against france as a background)

Helped Hannah figure out some twine basics

Came up with the idea of playing a fictional country managing the COVID-19 pandemic
Received suggestion to use a historical setting for another illness, like the Spanish Flu that was
even more deadly. Did consider how this could be implemented, but I think I'd rather opt for a critique
of the celebritization of political leaders in this particular case. (Hot take: Political leaders should
not be celebrities, it distracts from the position but at least it offers more transparency into their actions.

Re-familiarized myself with twine and wrote the first 'set' of choices.
