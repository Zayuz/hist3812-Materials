Day 2:
Opened twine file and completed the bulk of the game, everything except the ending pages.

Refined the project's main idea as a strategy sim parody. The stats are supposed to be 
meaningless, and all options lead to failure. An illusion of choice is given, but the unstoppable
disease takes its toll. The question is really as follows... How will you lose?

The game probably shouldn't be any more long or complex than 3 main choices, for the sake of 
the interstitial's scope and the solo nature of the project. For interstitial 2, I hope to do it in a group.

Because I could not make it into class today, I had little ability to bounce ideas off of others but I was
able to focus well on the work being done! Twine is fun to work with. Perhaps tomorrow some pictures will be
nice to include in the end-scenes.
