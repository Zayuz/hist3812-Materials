Day 3

While the story is 'finished', pictures were not as easily implemented as they were in prior versions of twine.
For even previous projects in other semesters, I had been able to embed images via a link into the text like so:
(image: [url]), or something very close to it. It seems that Harlowe, however, does not support this...

Despite my background as a computer science student, I famously passed Web Development with a 51, so I instead
chose to avoid HTML and focus my efforts on extending one of the passages to have an extra page or so, and deciding
that there should be an option to play again. This is as much for conveience as it is for poeticism, as a player
might have regrets about their choices, not knowing that they all lead to doom. Through replaying, instead of 
feeling like they messed up, they might realize that it was futile to begin with. No matter the course of action,
something was going to go wrong.

I write this before doing my reflection, which I'm sure will have much more insight!
