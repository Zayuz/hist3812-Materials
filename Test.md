![This is an image! I've used Github lots before as a computer science major, but I've never used the markdown language. Seems to work similarly to BBCode](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/878449885064609813/1010379431245778974/unknown.png)

_In hindsight it probably would make more sense to have read what was supposed to have gone on this page before playing with the markdown language..._

### Why does this tutorial level matter?

- It gets all of the students familir with github and the nature of multiple choice experiences
- Even for students familiar with github like myself, it encourages organization and style in notes and text
- It will provide feedback to the professor so that he can determine the class' starting point and confidence in the [unique type of environment](https://hist3812.netlify.app/goal/) we will be engaging with
