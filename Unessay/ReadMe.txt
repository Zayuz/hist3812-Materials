Hello! This unessay project was put together by Ryan Peckham alone except where credit is expressly given to others. \
This was created for DIGH3812, a course taught at Carleton University by Sean Graham.
This project features a heavy computational element discussed in the process text file, which left too little time to create a true game from what was created.
It is my hope that the reader finds the process I've undergone an interesting way to use technology to play with the past.
